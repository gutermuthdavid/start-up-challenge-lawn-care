      <p>Spring is an important season in terms of lawn care. While Fall is for re-building, Spring is all about prevention. As daytime temperatures start to rise and stay above the freezing mark, your lawn starts to come alive again. This is also the time when dormant weed seeds start to germinate. Distribute any of the above recommended fertilizer using your push spreader as early as the middle of February. Doing this will reduce the chances of having significant weed problems later on. Unfortunately, you can't prevent every single type of weed. Different types of weeds such as chick-weed, dandelion, etc. will grow in different periods during Spring. You can combat these weeds by spot spraying them with specific weed killer products or by simply physically removing them. <span style="color: red">IMPORTANT!</span> Allowing uninterupted growth is crucial in the Spring. Let the grass grow as tall as possible. Grass is growing both ways - above and below - ground. Allowing growth will help to establish a deep root system which will be very valuable in the next season. Don't forget, never mow the lawn too short - try to stay around the 4" mark.</p>
